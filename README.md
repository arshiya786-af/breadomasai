Key Learning Points and Improvements that Can be Made →
we have learned more then we had expected and now we know how to collaborate with people, we believe #MasaiSchool is doing really great job in collaboration part then the most of the school
out there and We had done best in our clone of the website and We know that nothing is perfect and there are few things that we can still improve like time management and some part of the JS and CSS but;
we made a really good effort of making the Website and We am proud it and our efforts.
Thank you for reading.
